## What is the Electronic Crystal Calculation Prep (ECCP) Program

The Electronic Crystal Calculation Prep (ECCP) program is designed create the ``Gaussian``/``ORCA`` files needed to perform DFT calculations upon the molecules in molecular crystals. The DFT calculations allow the user to calculate the electronic properties of molecules, such as:

* excited state properties, 
* reorganisation energies, 
* as well as electronic intermolecular properties, including electronic coupling, and exciton and charge diffusion. 

## Installation

It is recommended to read the installation page before using the ECCP program. See [Installation: Setting Up ECCP and Pre-Requisites Packages](Installation.md#Installation: Setting Up ECCP and Pre-Requisites Packages) for more information. Note that you can install ECCP through ``pip3`` and ``conda``. 

## Guide To Using ECCP

The ECCP program is one in a series of programs that are designed to be used in the workflow shown below. After you have installed ECCP, see [How To Use The ECCP Program](Guide_to_Using_the_ECCP_Program/Using_The_ECCP_Program.md) to learn about how to use this program. 

## The Grand Scheme

The ECCP program is used as part of a grand scheme for calculating the excited-state electronic properties of molecules in a crystal. This includes simulations of exciton and charge diffusion through crystal structures, in particular for organic molecules (but not limited to them). This scheme is shown below, along with where the ECCP program is used in this scheme.
