	This method is designed to determine all the spatially symmetric molecules in the unique_molecules_names list. 

	Parameters
	----------
	unique_molecules_names : list of ints
		This is a list of unique molecules based on the symmetry of the crystal.
	non_hydrogen_molecules_elements : dict of str. 
		These are the list of the elements of the atoms for each molecule in non_hydrogen_molecules

		These are the list of the positions of the atoms for each molecule in non_hydrogen_molecules
	all_no_of_H_on_atoms_in_molecule : dict of int
		This is a list of all the hydrogens that are bound to each "heavy" atom in the molecule
	max_distance_disparity : float
		This is the maximum disparity between two molecules to be considered invariant. If max_distance_disparity is given as None, the default value will be given. Default: 0.01 Ã….

		This is the information about the molecules that surround (in the vicinity of) each moleule in the crystal.
