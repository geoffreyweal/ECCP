	This method looks for the elements in lowest abundance and aligns them between molecules to determine if they are the same or not.

	This method works best if your molecule contains one or a few elements that are in low abundance in the molecule.

	Parameters
	----------
	unique_molecules_names : list of ints
		This is a list of unique molecules based on the symmetry of the crystal.
	non_hydrogen_molecules_elements : dict of str. 
		These are the list of the elements of the atoms for each molecule in non_hydrogen_molecules
	non_hydrogen_molecules_positions : dict of 2D np.array
		These are the list of the positions of the atoms for each molecule in non_hydrogen_molecules
	all_no_of_H_on_atoms_in_molecule : dict of int
		This is a list of all the hydrogens that are bound to each "heavy" atom in the molecule
	max_distance_disparity : float
		This is the maximum disparity between two molecules to be considered invariant. If max_distance_disparity is given as None, the default value will be given. Default: 0.01 Ã….
	neighbouring_molecules_about_molecules : dict.
		This is the information about the molecules that surround (in the vicinity of) each moleule in the crystal.
	non_hydrogen_molecules : dict of ase.Atoms
		These are the original ase.Atoms object with their hydrogens removed. This is for debugging. 
	non_hydrogen_graphs : dict. of networkx.Graph
		These are the non-hydrogen graphs for the corresponding molecules in non_hydrogen_molecules. Here, hydrogens has been removed as nodes and instead been append to each "heavy" atom node as a node variable. 
	no_of_cpus : int.
		This is the number of cpus available to use on this program. In most cases this should just be set to 1 cpu, however for very large system you may want to implement multiple cpus.
